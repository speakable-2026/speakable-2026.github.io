      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      
      <h3>Submission Portal</h3>
      <p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

        <em>Submission link will be available soon</em>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Paper Scope and Types</h3>
      <p>LREC 2026 accepts papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in natural language processing, computational linguistics, language resources, and multimodal interaction. Submissions spanning multiple categories (theories/models, NLP applications, language resources, evaluation, and general interest topics) are particularly welcome.</p>
      <p>Papers may be submitted as <strong>Oral</strong>, <strong>Poster</strong>, or <strong>Poster with Demo</strong> presentations.</p>
      
      <h3>Format and Requirements</h3>
      <p>Submissions should be <strong>4 to 8 pages</strong> in length (excluding references, ethics statements, acknowledgements, and data/code availability statements). Papers must follow the <strong>LREC 2026 stylesheet</strong>. LaTeX and Overleaf templates are available via the <a href="https://softconf.com/lrec2026/main" target="_blank">LREC 2026 Author's Kit</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Key requirements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> 150-200 words</li>
        <li><strong>No appendices</strong> during submission (allowed only in camera-ready version)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note: Papers not using the official LREC 2026 template will be rejected.</em></p>
      
      <h3>Anonymization and Originality</h3>
      <p>To ensure a fair double-blind review process, all submissions must be <strong>fully anonymized</strong>. Papers should not include author names, affiliations, or identifying information. Use anonymous repositories (e.g., Anonymous GitHub) for code sharing. Papers failing to meet anonymization requirements will be rejected without review.</p>
      <p>All submitted work must be <strong>original and previously unpublished</strong>. There is <strong>no anonymity period</strong> for LREC 2026—authors may publish preprints at any time. However, concurrent submissions to other venues must be declared at submission time.</p>
      
      <h3>Ethics Statement</h3>
      <p>We strongly encourage authors to include an <strong>ethics statement</strong> addressing the broader societal impact of their work and any relevant ethical considerations. This statement should appear after the conclusion but before the references and does not count toward the page limit.</p>
      
      <h3>Language Resources and Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Authors may share related language resources at submission time. All entries are linked to the <a href="https://lremap.elra.info/" target="_blank">LRE Map</a>, which provides resource metadata.</p>
      <p>Please prioritize accessibility in your paper: ensure grayscale readability for color-blind readers, always name the language(s) under study, and provide English translations and Latin transliterations for non-English/non-Latin text.</p>
      
      <h3>Accepted Papers and Presentation</h3>
      <p>Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings in the same format regardless of presentation type (oral/poster). Presentation format decisions are based on optimal communication methods given the paper content.</p>
      <p><strong>Workshop Proceedings will be published on the LREC 2026 website</strong> and licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY-NC-4.0</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Presentation is mandatory</strong> for all accepted papers, and at least one author must register for LREC 2026. The conference will be held <strong>in-person</strong>.</p>
