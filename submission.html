      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      
      <h3>Submission Portal</h3>
      <p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <a href="#" class="cta-button" style="display: inline-block; opacity: 0.6; cursor: not-allowed;">Submit Your Paper</a>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem; color: #6b7280;">
        <em>Submission link will be available soon</em>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Format and Requirements</h3>
      <p>Submissions should be <strong>4 to 8 pages</strong> in length (excluding references and potential Ethics Statements). Submissions should follow the <strong>LREC stylesheet</strong>, available on the conference website on the Author's Kit page. All templates are also available from this page.</p>
      
      <h3>Anonymization and Originality</h3>
      <p>To ensure a fair double-blind review process, all submissions must be <strong>fully anonymized</strong>. Author names, affiliations, and identifying information should not appear in the manuscript. Avoid including links to non-anonymized code repositories; instead, use anonymous sharing platforms (e.g., Anonymous GitHub, Anonym Share) or plan to include code as supplementary material in the camera-ready version. Papers failing to meet anonymization requirements will be desk-rejected.</p>
      <p>All submitted work must be <strong>original and previously unpublished</strong>.</p>
      
      <h3>Ethics Statement</h3>
      <p>We strongly encourage authors to include an <strong>ethics statement</strong> addressing the broader societal impact of their work and any relevant ethical considerations. This statement should appear after the conclusion but before the references and does not count toward the page limit.</p>
      
      <h3>Language Resources</h3>
      <p>At the time of submission, authors are offered the opportunity to share related language resources with the community. All repository entries are linked to the LRE Map, which provides metadata for the resource.</p>
      
      <h3>Accepted Papers and Presentation</h3>
      <p>Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings, which include both oral and poster papers in the same format. Determination of the presentation format (oral vs. poster) is based solely on an assessment of the optimal method of communication (more or less interactive), given the paper content.</p>
      <p><strong>Presentation is mandatory</strong> for all accepted papers, and at least one author must register for LREC 2026. The conference will be held <strong>in-person</strong>. All authors will be required to upload a presentation video, slides, and (for poster presentations) a poster PDF to the Conference Catalysts platform. These materials will be included in the LREC 2026 online proceedings.</p>
