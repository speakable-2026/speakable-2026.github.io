      <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
      
      <h3>Submission Portal</h3>
      <p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <a href="https://softconf.com/lrec2026/main" target="_blank" class="cta-button" style="display: inline-block;">Submit Your Paper</a>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <a href="https://softconf.com/lrec2026/main" target="_blank" style="color: #0891b2;">https://softconf.com/lrec2026/main</a>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Format and Requirements</h3>
      <p>Submissions should be <strong>4 to 8 pages</strong> in length (excluding references and potential Ethics Statements). Submissions should follow the <strong>LREC stylesheet</strong>, available on the conference website on the Author's Kit page. All templates are also available from this page.</p>
      
      <h3>Language Resources</h3>
      <p>At the time of submission, authors are offered the opportunity to share related language resources with the community. All repository entries are linked to the LRE Map, which provides metadata for the resource.</p>
      
      <h3>Accepted Papers</h3>
      <p>Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings, which include both oral and poster papers in the same format. Determination of the presentation format (oral vs. poster) is based solely on an assessment of the optimal method of communication (more or less interactive), given the paper content.</p>
      
      <h3>Review Process</h3>
      <p>We anticipate 20–25 submissions. Each submission will receive at least three reviews from our program committee of domain experts.</p>
      
      <h3>Expected Attendance</h3>
      <p>30–40 participants from academia, industry, and community organizations.</p>
